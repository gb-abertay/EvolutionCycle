<<==Usage Guide - Gameplay (Bike Sensor)==>

1.  Cycle to move character along set path.
2. The harder you cycle the faster you will go.
3. If you output enough power (determined by the selected profile), the character will change states.
4. Before an obstacle you must power up, this will be indicated by a bar at the bottom of your screen being overlapped by the dotted line,
    a character icon in the bottom left, and a sign popping up in the bottom right of the screen.
5. While the coloured box is overlapping the dotted line, you must maintain the correct power state (i.e blue character while blue box is showing).
6. The resistance of the bike will change during obstacles to help you output the right amount of power.
7. You will pass an obstacle if you spend the majority of the buildup to an obstacle in the right state.

<<==Known Issues==>

 - The giant duck will sometimes spontaneously explode (ruins immersion but game still works)
 - If you start game play in windowed or in full screen, keep in the same format or bar at bottom of gameplay will be miss aligned (i.e. no alt-enter after pressing play)
 - User Interface and Menu's layouts will start to break if they are not in full screen on a 16:9 ratio monitor. (Game will still function in other resolutions, elements may be miss     aligned)
 - On the sensor connection screen the tick symbol indicated a sensor is connect sometimes remains even after disconneting from a device (however there are still other     indicators to rely on)

<<==Solutions For Sensor Issues==>

 - Check sensor connection screen, via the main menu or the pause screen.
 - Ensure ANT USB STICK has clear line of sight of sensor and is in close proximity (consider using USB extension to get them closer to each other).
 - Ensure ANT USB STICK is plugged in correctly.
 - Ensure no other program is using the ANT USB STICK.
 - Unplug and replug ANT USB STICK if issues still occur.
 - Ensure "Power" or "FE-C Trainer" sensors are ANT+ compatible.
 - Ensure there is power indicator on sensor.
 - Check to make sure sensor is not connected to other program.
 - Close and open game.
 - Delete and redownload game. (Last resort)
